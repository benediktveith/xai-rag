Clinically, it has been observed that a patient&#x27;s first described feeling of nausea can be interpreted as a precursor to hypotension.

Anginal equivalents vary, but they are commonly described as shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue disproportionate to the activity level. It is important to distinguish between cardiac and non-cardiac chest discomfort. Discussing the details of the patient’s symptoms further guide this differentiation.

Vasodilator stress is recommended in all patients who are unable to exercise or who are unable to tolerate submaximal exercise.

If there is motor nerve involvement, patients will also complain of weakness in the involved nerve&#x27;s myotomal distribution.[2] On the physical exam, it is essential to test motor strength, sensation, and reflexes bilaterally.

Overall, the estimated incidence is 25% following spinal anesthesia.[23] The management of post-dural puncture headaches has been a topic of debate, with current practice favoring the placement of an epidural blood patch as a treatment for the presumed pathological mechanism of CSF leak following the puncture [21].

The latter can present in those with an advanced and severe disease course. It has a monophasic course with varying onset, progression, and recovery degrees.

A third rectus capitis muscle was found in the suboccipital region in 1 patient.[6] In another instance, there was a unilateral absence of rectus capitis posterior minor muscle replaced with 2 rectus capitis posterior major muscles.[7] Both of these variants may provide further insight and explanations for the development of cervicogenic headaches.

The outer ear is composed of the auricle or pinna, the external auditory canal, and the tympanic membrane. The main function of the outer ear structures is to collect and localize sound and provide a passageway into the middle ear cavity. The tympanic membrane serves to divides the outer and middle ear and convert sound waves into vibration.
